# Coca-Cola-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Coca-Cola sales data using cleaned data, SQL for advanced statistical analysis, and Tableau for visualization. It explores sales trends, promotion impact, customer segmentation, and forecasting, turning raw data into actionable insights for business decisions.

### Project Overview

  - This project delivers an advanced analysis of Coca-Cola sales data using SQL and Tableau. Since the dataset is already cleaned, the focus is on leveraging SQL for statistical analysis to uncover     sales patterns, seasonal trends, and product performance across regions. Tableau is then used to create interactive dashboards that visualize key insights, highlight correlations, and forecast       future demand. The objective is to transform structured sales data into actionable business intelligence that supports decisions in marketing, pricing, and inventory optimization.
